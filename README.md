Weapon Ammunition as Items


## Description
* We all know the issue with ESX and Weapon Ammunition. With this Script you get Ammo as Items.
  * So if you have 10x 9mm items in your inventory you can shoot 10 times.
* You can set as many items as you want in config.lua

If you want to have Weapon Components and Tints then use this: https://forum.cfx.re/t/esx-msk-weaponammo-clips-components-tints/4793783

## Requirements
* ESX 1.2 and above
